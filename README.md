# Raspberry-Pi-Full-Stack-Revisited
Reworking Elements from the Tech Explorations Raspberry Pi Full Stack Raspbian Class 

This respository contains various code framents that have been created, modified and substituted for their counter parts in the Tech Explorations Raspberry Pi Full Stack and Arduino Step-By-Step Getting Started courses. This work is a departure from these two courses and intended purely as an analysis of the process involved. The analysis is from both a CLI and GUI perspective. The GUI assumes the default 'pi' user and the CLI offers a perspective that more closely follows the Tech Explorations Raspbery Pi-FS conventions. Both the GUI and CLI perspectives share a common SQLite3 database. Understanding these code fragments assumes a working understanding of the two Tech Explorations courses cited.
